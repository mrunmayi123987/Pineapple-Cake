Today we are going to prepare pineapple cake .
We all love to have pineapple cake. So as in all cakes we add refined flour in this cake also we are going to add it . We are also going to add baking powder and baking soda so that the cake becomes fluppy and rises up.
After all dry ingredients we are going to add melted butter . We are going to add condensed milk so that are cake becomes sweet. Then by adding some milk in it we will mix the batter. We will mix it till all the batter becomes smooth and there are no lumps in it. 
Then we will bake the cake and serve it hot.
